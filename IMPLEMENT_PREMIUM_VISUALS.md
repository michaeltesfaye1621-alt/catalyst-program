# Premium & State-of-the-Art Visual Update Plan

This document outlines the implementation steps to elevate The Catalyst Physio from a professional landing page to a world-class, premium digital experience. The focus is on visual depth, high-end micro-interactions, and psychological trust signals.

## 1. Visual Depth & Atmosphere
- [x] **Background Texture & Grain**
  - [x] Apply a subtle noise overlay to the main layout to reduce flatness.
  - [x] Implement animated "mesh-gradient" blobs in the background for organic movement.
- [x] **Advanced Glassmorphism**
  - [x] Enhance cards with triple-layered borders (Inner border: `primary/30`, Outer: `white/5`).
  - [x] Increase `backdrop-blur` for a more distinct "frosted glass" look.

## 2. Dynamic Interactions & Micro-animations
- [x] **Magnetic CTA Utility**
  - [x] Create a reusable hook for magnetic cursor attraction.
  - [x] Apply to primary CTAs (Hero, Pricing, Footer).
- [ ] **SVG Icon Animations**
  - [ ] Transition from static Lucide icons to "drawing" SVG animations on scroll.
  - [ ] Focus on Roadmap icons (Flame, Wrench, Shield).
- [x] **Specialist Signature**
  - [x] Add a hand-drawn SVG signature for Dr. Thorne.
  - [x] Implement a path-reveal animation triggered when scrolling to "Who guides your recovery".

## 3. High-End Typography & Branding
- [x] **Glowing Text Effects**
  - [x] Implement a "shimmer" or "flowing energy" gradient masked inside the main Hero text.
  - [x] Use variable font weights to animate emphasis words on hover/scroll.
- [ ] **Digital Product Visualization**
  - [ ] Use `generate_image` to create high-fidelity mockups of the "Custom App Video Portal". (Failed due to capacity)
  - [ ] Implement a floating/parallax tilt effect on these mockups.

## 4. Trust & Logical Proof (Authority)
- [x] **"As Seen In" / Partner Logobar**
  - [x] Add a grayscale, high-contrast bar of clinical and athletic partner logos.
- [x] **Method Comparison Table**
  - [x] Create a high-contrast side-by-side comparison (The Catalyst vs. Traditional Therapy).
  - [x] Use iconography to highlight "Root Cause" vs "Symptom Management".
- [x] **Interactive Self-Assessment**
  - [x] Build a 3-question "Biomechanical Health Quiz".
  - [x] Provide dynamic feedback + call to action based on their score.

## 5. Advanced UX & Feedback
- [x] **Scroll Progress Indicator**
  - [x] Add a subtle primary-colored progress bar at the top of the viewport.
- [x] **Hover-to-Reveal Data**
  - [x] In Case Studies, keep the quote primary and reveal "Success Stats" on hover.
- [x] **Section Transitions**
  - [x] Implement staggered "reveal-up" animations with custom easing (`cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)`).
